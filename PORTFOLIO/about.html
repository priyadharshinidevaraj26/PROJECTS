                <h3>I'm Nanthitha</h3>
                <p> I am a passionate and motivated individual currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology at Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Technology, Coimbatore. With a CGPA of 8.378, I have always been eager to learn and apply my knowledge in dynamic and challenging environments.  
                    I have successfully completed certifications in IoT and Python through NPTEL, along with a Business English Certificate from Linguaskill, which has helped me develop both my technical expertise and communication skills. During my internship at Tenneco Automotive India Pvt Ltd, I gained hands-on experience in front-end development, working with HTML and CSS.  
                    My technical skills include proficiency in C, C++, Python, and full-stack development, and I take pride in my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills. Additionally, I am fluent in English, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam, which allows me to communicate effectively with diverse groups.  
                    I am excited to grow in the tech industry, contribute my skills, and embrace new opportunities.</p>
